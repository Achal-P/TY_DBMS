--Database Trigger (All Types: Row level and Statement level triggers, Before and After Triggers). 
Write a database trigger on the student table. The System should keep track of the records that are 
being  updated  or  deleted.  The  old  value  of  updated  or  deleted  records  should  be  added  in 
the Student_Audit table (Action may be delete or update), date of action should be recorded--


Student(roll, name) 
Student_Audit (roll, name, action, date) 
CREATE TABLE Student ( 
    roll INT PRIMARY KEY, 
    name VARCHAR2(100) 
); 
 
CREATE TABLE Student_Audit ( 
    roll INT, 
    name VARCHAR2(100), 
    action VARCHAR2(10),   -- Stores 'UPDATE' or 'DELETE' 
    action_date DATE 
); 
 -- Trigger to capture updates on Student records 
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER student_update_audit 
BEFORE UPDATE ON Student 
FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN 
    INSERT INTO Student_Audit (roll, name, action, action_date) 
    VALUES (:OLD.roll, :OLD.name, 'UPDATE', SYSDATE); 
END; 
/ 
 -- Trigger to capture deletions from Student records 
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER student_delete_audit 
BEFORE DELETE ON Student 
FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN 
    INSERT INTO Student_Audit (roll, name, action, action_date) 
    VALUES (:OLD.roll, :OLD.name, 'DELETE', SYSDATE); 
END;
