--Write a PL/SQL code block to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle for a value of length 
varying from 10 to 20 and breadth varying from 5 to 10.  
Store the length and breadth and the corresponding values of the calculated area and perimeter in an 
empty table named areas, consisting of three  columns, length, breadth  and area.--
